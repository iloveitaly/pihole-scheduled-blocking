# PiHole With Scheduled Blocking

This docker image extends the default pihole image to provide a mechanism to automatically block and allow websites based on a schedule.

It also blocks DNS over HTTPS, blocks a wider array of sites by default (porn, gambling, malware, etc), and allows alexa to work even if you schedule amazon.com to be blocked.
